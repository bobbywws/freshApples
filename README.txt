This is my final project for my Full Mean Stack Web Development bootcamp, RefactorU. It is basically a rip off of Rotten Tomatoes, 
Wikipedia, and Facebook. Users should (when finished) have the ability to add movies to a database, review movies that are already
in the database, and review other people's reviews, as well as add them as friends. The DB is from a Mongo base, and is obviously local.
